# Lost in the Wild Memory Game
_“Life is more fun if you play games.” - Roald Dahl_

Lost in the Wild is a web-based single-player memory game. Its objective is to find all the matching pairs of animals hiding in the wild. Memory games like this one, while fun to play, can also be used as tools to improve a player's short-term memory, attention, concentration, and focus.

The game was built as my second milestone project for Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development course. The topic for the project was chosen because the memory game (Pexeso) was one of my most favourite games growing up.
